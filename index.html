          Dianna M. Milewicz, M.D. Ph.D., is the President George H.W. Bush Chair of Cardiovascular Medicine, Director of the Division of Medical Genetics and the John Ritter Research Program at McGovern Medical School, and Director of the joint MD-PhD Program between MD Anderson Cancer Center and at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), and recruits students from the University of Puerto Rico. Dr Milewicz’s career focuses on research to identify the genetic and molecular triggers for vascular diseases and mentoring the next generation of physician scientists. Her research has identified the altered genes triggering vascular diseases, with an initial and continued emphasis on thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, and more recently focus on moyamoya disease and early onset atherosclerosis. She has also sought to identify the molecular links between the defective genes and the resulting vascular diseases. She chairs two international research consortiums, the Montalcino Aortic Consortium to define precision medical care for genetic vascular diseases and a Leducq Network of Excellence to identify molecular triggers for acute aortic dissections. She was inducted into the honorary societies for physician scientists, the American Society of Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians (AAP), and currently serves as an AAP Council member.  Dr. Milewicz has worked to increase awareness of risk factors for acute aortic dissections, including participating and chairing boards for the American Heart Association, Canadian Genetic Aortic Disorder Association, the John Ritter Foundation, and the Marfan Foundation. She has received numerous honors for her research, mentorship and advocacy, including Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award, American Heart Association Merit Award, Rice University Distinguished Alumni Award, and the 2023 Advocacy Award from the American Society of Human Genetics, and will be receiving the 2024 Genomic and Precision Medicine Medal of Honor from the American Heart Association at the meeting in November.

He holds BS/MSE degrees in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, and completed MD/PhD training at the UTHealth Houston/MDACC MSTP, during which time he served on APSA's executive council and chaired the AMA Medical Student Section's Committee on Scientific Issues. He completed adult neurology residency at UCLA with dedicated NIH Research Education Program (R25)-supported research, before a postdoctoral fellowship in multimodality molecular imaging and clinical fellowship in neuro-oncology at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he was supported by the Stanford Cancer Institute's Fellowship Award and American Brain Tumor Association's Basic Research Fellowship supported by the Ryan J. Hanrahan Memorial. He also served on the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Associate Member Council (AMC). He then started on faculty at Stanford in the neurology and radiology departments, where he served as the adult neuro-oncology fellowship program director. He was awarded a Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Neuroscience:Translate Grant that led to the development of a minimally-invasive technology for measuring intracranial pressure, which is the basis for a start-up (SensoBrain). He was recognized as one of the 40 Under 40 in Cancer Rising Stars and Emerging Leaders. Dr. Patel was subsequently recruited to MDACC as a McNair Scholar. His translational research laboratory at MDACC studies alternating electric fields as a form of anti-cancer therapy (with one issued patent and another pending); neuronal-brain cancer interactions; and molecular imaging and advanced neuroimaging to enable earlier detection of disease progression in patients with brain cancer. His research is supported by the McNair Medical Institute at The Robert and Janice McNair Foundation, the AACR-Novocure Career Development Award for Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) Research, and the MDACC Cancer Neuroscience Program. He co-chairs the neuro-oncology track at the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics Annual World Congress (Los Angeles) and chairs the AI in Clinical Diagnostics session at the THINK AI Healthcare Conference (Stanford).
